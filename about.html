                <div class="about-text">
                    The Five elms is a Grade 2 listed, thatched country pub in the heart of Buckinhmashire.
                    It has history dating back to the late 18th century, named after five local Elm trees.
                    The Pub is the last of three original pubs opened in Weedon. The Five Elms was originally licensed 1754 and is still going strong today.
                    Here at the Five Elms we offer a quintessential Dining Experience, using local and sustainable produce with modern techniques and style. We are passionate about our aims which are to serve great food that has to be seasonal, inspirational and, above all, delicious.
                    We accompany this with a wide range of quality wines and a variety of cask ales, lagers and cider.
